# ggjoy

Geoms to make joyplots using ggplot2, written by Claus O. Wilke

This package has now been officially relased on CRAN. Most things should work as expected, and the API should now be relatively stable. For feedback and feature requests, please open issues on github.

## About joyplots

Joyplots are partially overlapping line plots that create the impression of a mountain range. They can be quite useful for visualizing changes in distributions over time or space. The name "joyplot" was [proposed](
https://twitter.com/JennyBryan/status/856674638981550080) by Jenny Bryan on Twitter on April 24, 2017, in reference to the [iconic cover art](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/pop-culture-pulsar-origin-story-of-joy-division-s-unknown-pleasures-album-cover-video/) for Joy Division's album _Unknown Pleasures_.

## Installation

Stable release:

```{r eval = FALSE}

## Usage

```{r diamonds}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggjoy)
    
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price, y = cut)) +
  geom_joy(scale = 4) + theme_joy() +
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +   # will generally have to set the `expand` option
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))      # for both axes to remove unneeded padding
```
